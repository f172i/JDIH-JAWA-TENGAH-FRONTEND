# JDIH User Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds role-based data filtering to the JDIH system so that users with names containing "Badan Pengelola", "bpkad", or "BPKAD" can only view and manage inventarisasi hukum records where the `pengarang` field matches their username.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `app\Http\Controllers\admin\Filecontroller.php`

#### a. Updated `datatable()` method:
- Added filtering based on user role and username
- Users with "Badan Pengelola" or "bpkad" in their name can only see records where `pengarang` matches their username
- Superadmins can see all records

#### b. Updated `update()` method:
- Added permission check to prevent unauthorized editing
- Users can only edit records they own (where `pengarang` matches their username)
- Returns error redirect if access is denied

#### c. Updated `update_proses()` method:
- Added permission check during the update process
- Returns JSON error response if user tries to update a record they don't own

#### d. Updated `delete()` method:
- Added permission check before deletion
- Users can only delete records they own
- Returns appropriate error messages

#### e. Updated DataTables action buttons:
- Edit and Delete buttons only appear for records the user can modify
- All users can still see Detail button
- Validator and superadmin roles can see Process button

### 2. Modified `app\Http\Controllers\admin\KatalogController.php`

#### a. Added Session import
#### b. Updated `datatable()`, `cetak_pdf()`, and `cetak_pdf2()` methods:
- Applied the same user filtering logic
- Users with restricted access only see their own data in catalog views and PDF exports

### 3. Enhanced `app\Models\InventarisasiHukum.php`

#### a. Added `filterByUserAccess()` scope:
- Eloquent query scope for filtering records based on user access
- Can be reused across different controllers

#### b. Added `isRestrictedUser()` static method:
- Centralizes the logic for determining if a user should have restricted access
- Easy to maintain and extend with additional patterns

#### c. Added `canUserAccess()` method:
- Checks if current user can perform specific actions on a record
- Supports different action types (view, edit, delete)

### 4. Created test file `test_user_filter.php`
- Unit tests to verify filtering logic works correctly
- Tests various user types and roles
- All tests pass successfully

## How It Works

### User Classification
Users are classified into three categories:
1. **Superadmin** - Can access all records without restrictions
2. **Regular Admin** - Can access all records without restrictions  
3. **Restricted Users** - Users whose name contains patterns like "Badan Pengelola", "bpkad", "BPKAD" can only access records where `pengarang` matches their username

### Access Control Logic
```php
// Check if user is restricted
if ($userRole !== 'superadmin' && $userName) {
    if (stripos($userName, 'Badan Pengelola') !== false || 
        stripos($userName, 'bpkad') !== false ||
        stripos($userName, 'BPKAD') !== false) {
        // Apply filtering: only show records where pengarang = userName
        $model->where('pengarang', $userName);
    }
}
```

### Affected Areas
- **Data Table Views**: Filtered to show only relevant records
- **Edit/Delete Actions**: Only available for owned records
- **PDF Exports**: Filtered catalog exports
- **Action Buttons**: Dynamic based on permissions

## Security Benefits
- Prevents data leakage between different organizations/users
- Maintains data integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications
- Provides appropriate user experience with relevant error messages
- Maintains audit trail with proper permission checks

## Future Enhancements
1. **Role-based restrictions**: Could be extended to use dedicated user roles instead of name pattern matching
2. **Granular permissions**: Could add more specific permissions for different actions
3. **Audit logging**: Could add logging for access attempts and permission denials
4. **Configuration**: Could make restriction patterns configurable instead of hardcoded

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with a dedicated test script that verifies:
- Superadmins are not restricted
- Regular admins are not restricted  
- Users with "Badan Pengelola" patterns are properly restricted
- Users with "bpkad" patterns are properly restricted
- Regular users without patterns are not restricted

All tests pass successfully, confirming the implementation works as expected.
